Repository containing my work for uni laboratories. Here I try to solve simple numerical methods problems.

Done so far:

- Imaginary number addition and multiplication
- Factorial
- value of "e"
- Matrix multiplication
- Determinant using Sarrus method
- Determinant using Laplace
- Crammer Rule
- Matrix inverse
- In work:
- Inverse Matrix Method
- Gauss elimination
- Jordan Gauss elimination
